## Phase 1 (Independent Review)

Each of us read the explainer silently and formed a private judgment before discussion.

- The core mechanism (“tool use = structured token generation + parsing”) was clear and well-explained.
- The step-by-step breakdown of token-level behavior, schema injection, and parsing landed strongly.
- However, one gap remained: the explanation was initially abstract and did not fully connect to the actual behavior observed in the Week 10 pipeline.

## Phase 2 (Evening Call Discussion)

During the call, we focused on grounding the explanation in real system behavior.

**What landed well:**
- Clear explanation that the model does not execute tools, only generates token sequences.
- Strong framing of tool use as a probability distribution over structured vs natural language outputs.
- Actionable guidance on improving schema design and prompting.

**What did not land initially:**
- The explainer did not explicitly verify whether tool use was actually happening in the system.
- It assumed tool-use capability without checking real outputs.

## Key Diagnostic Step (New Insight)

We ran the Week 10 pipeline (`test_pipeline.py`) and inspected the output.

Observed:
- The system produced a structured “FINAL BRIEF” entirely from Python modules.
- No schema-compliant JSON tool calls were emitted by the model.
- No evidence of model-driven tool selection.

**Conclusion:**
The system is a **deterministic pipeline**, not an inference-time tool-using agent.
